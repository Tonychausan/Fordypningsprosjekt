{\centering\huge\bfseries Abstract \par}
The Myo armband is a wearable gesture and motion control device that uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer, to recognize gestures. In this project we will use the Myo armband to detect and translate simple hand signs.

\section{Gesture Recognition}
The study of human-computer interaction has developed to put a significant amount of effort in on user-friendly interfaces employing voice, vision, gesture, and other innovative I/O channels. One of the most challenging approaches in this research field is to link neural signals with computers by exploiting the electrical nature of the human nervous system. The development of an EMG-based interface for hand gesture recognition is presented in \cite{kim2008emg}, where an EMG-sensor is positioned on the inside of the forearm to recognize control signs in the gestures.

Gesture-based control is one of the major application for hand gesture recognition technologies. Another major application is sign language recognition. Sign Language recognition aim to help the deaf communicate with the hearing society conveniently. This paper \cite{zhang2011framework} presents a framework for hand gesture recognition based on the information of a three-axis accelerometer and multichannel EMG sensors.

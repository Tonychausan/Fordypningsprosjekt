\chapter{Abstract}
The Myo armband is a gesture recognition device that uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity in the forearm, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer to recognize gestures. It can also give haptic feedback vibrations.

Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. An electromyograph detects the electrical potential generated by muscle cells.

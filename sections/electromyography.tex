\section{Electomyography (EMG)}
Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique to measure muscle response or electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles \cite{wiki:Electromyography}. The nerves control the muscles by electrical signal called impulse, these impulses can be measured and analyzed \cite{WebMD:Electromyogram}. There are different method to measure those signals, but this project use surface EMG. Surface EMG is a technique where electrodes are places on the skin overlying a muscle to detect nerve impulses.

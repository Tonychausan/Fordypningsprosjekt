\section{Alternative Gesture Control Methods}
\sloppy
The ability of tracking position and movement for gesture recognition can be archived by various approaches. The Myo armband uses accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to keep track of the orientation, and EMG-sensors to measure electric activity of the muscle. Other tool such as Kinect and Leap Motion is based on a more visual approach. 

\subsection{Gesture Gloves}
Hand gestures is movements of the arms and fingers, and one possible approach to track movement of the arms and fingers is to place sensors directly on the fingers, for example in the form of a glove. Two University of Washington undergraduates have won a \$10,000 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for gloves that can translate sign language into text or speech \cite{uw:SignAloud}. Another example is the out-of-the-self gesture glove from Maestro Gesture Glove \cite{maestroglove}.

\subsection{Image-based Gesture Control}
Leap Motion \cite{leap_motion} and Kinect \cite{kinect} are two commonly used sensors for tracking motions by utilizing technology such as infrared cameras, infrared LEDs, RGB camera, and depth sensor. Unlike the other mentioned devices, Leap Motion and Kinect observe the movements, instead of touching the user. Leap Motion and Kinect utilize different technologies, thus have different advantages and disadvantages, but conceptually, they work in the same manner. There are some different ASL related work based on both Leap Motion \cite{potter2013leap,chuan2014american} and Kinect \cite{zafrulla2011american,lang2012sign,chai2013sign}, but also work that tries to utilize the advantage of both by combining the sensors \cite{marin2014hand}.

{\centering\huge\bfseries Abstract \par}
The Myo armband is a wearable gesture and motion control device that uses a set of electromyographic sensors that sense electrical activity, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer, to recognize gestures. This report will present a development of a prototype-level system that use the Myo armband to detect and translate simple hand gestures to something coherent.

About 70 million deaf people use sign language as their first language or mother tongue, but the lack of a common language between deaf and hearing individuals makes communication difficult. This report aims to explore the potential of utilizing electromyography and Inertial Measurement Units to help communication between deaf and hearing individuals.
